# New Version Out - 11/12/09 #

A simple system tray notifier for Google Voice. Lets you know when you have unread text or voice messages. The project is written in java and uses Google Voice's REST service calls. This notifier will work on any platform that supports the java system tray icon.

Planned for version 1.4:
  * New Icons
  * Support for sound when receiving a message.
  * A Cannot Connect notification.
  * Allow saved passwords.


Version 1.3 is now available. Changes:
  * Proxy support now works.
  * Various small improvements to the options.
  * Added the ability to check for updates.

Version 1.1a is now available. Changes:
  * Fixed a bug with input validation for proxy settings.

Version 1.1 is now available. Changes:
  * Added http and socks proxy support to the options.
  * Now the delay between checks is in seconds (instead of milliseconds).
